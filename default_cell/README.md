### Default Cell

This extension adds a default cell at the start of a notebook and a new default cell above the current working kernel at the click of a button present in the toolbar. To change the properties of default cell, edit the `add_cell` function in `main.js` file . To change the default cells `python` part of code, you can add new import functions in text variable. 


This extension adds a button to the toolbar allowing you to insert and run the default cell above your current cell. This can be helpful if you like to divide your imports with sections in the notebook.

The extension is inspired by a learning project by the author(Will Koehrsen) .
